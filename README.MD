# NFS: World Car Unlimiter

Unlocks car limits in Need for Speed: World (NFSW), allowing a theoretical maximum of **65,536 cars** (in practice, this limit is lower, but still more than enough.) Also fixes some game issues such as missing parts on cars.

## Installation

An ASI is available. Install [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/v4.52/Ultimate-ASI-Loader.zip) to your NFSW folder if you don't already have it installed (use dinput8.dll). Then put the ASI into the **scripts** folder in your game folder (create it if it doesn't exist.) Then run your game. No configuration is required.
